For a user tree I pruned the phylogeny of all neoaves bird families (Jarvis et al. 2014)
Here I pruned to four taxa that were the same as the genes used in this study or representatives from their 
respective orders to include:
Bucerotiformes = Buceros
Coraciiformes = Merops
Piciformes = Colaptes
Trogoniformes = Apaloderma
This tree was pruned in step 8b, producing unrooted_pruned_tre.tre. The tree was then modified by substituting Colaptes for Picoides in the .tre file (for ease of use with phyml).


With the four-fold degenerate sites alignment of the four individuals, I estimated a model of sequence evolution using 
jModelTest
best model as decided by AIC = GTR + I

# Here, I used an unrooted four taxon user tree for use in PhyML to estimate branch lengths using 14a_phyml_command

# next, to estimate the substitution rate in Colaptes, estimate the % divergence by the branch length in the tree
# and dividing that by the mean and 95% HPD of the divergence time between Colaptes and Merops (more details on mutation rate estimates for other orders in 15_mutation_rate_estimation.R
# divergence times from input phylogeny (in millions of years): mean = 42.3418, 95% HPD = 34.1 - 48.0
# calculation = colaptes_branch_length / (divergence_times * 1e6)
# in r:
0.16969979/(c(34.1, 42.3418, 48.0) * 1e6)
# output: 4.976533e-09 4.007855e-09 3.535412e-09
