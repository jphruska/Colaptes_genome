Arcs scaffolding workflow. 

1. Using pilon polished genome as input and interleaved linked reads file produced with LongRanger were inputted to the ARCS pipeline. 
2. Performed three rounds of ARCS, wherein each round multiple iterations of the pipelin were run to evaluate which parameter combination produced the assembly of highest quality.
